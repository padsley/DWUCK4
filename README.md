# DWUCK4
In light of the website of Peter Kunz (Colorado) now not being online, I have made this repo for DWUCK4 from the version that's on my computer

Note that this is not my code. If you want me to take this repo offline then send me an e-mail.

If you would like help with DWUCK, I can try - send me an e-mail.

If you're looking for CHUCK3 - at present, that can be found in my 'AngCorPackage' repo.
